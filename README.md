# Kaarpooool
Allows you to optimize carpool/bus pickup and dropoff routing -- saves time, fuel costs, and CO2 emissions when carpooling
* Note that the algorithm and the server are currently disconnected -- more work is coming later to get them linked up

I created a new repository b/c the API key got leaked the first time around
